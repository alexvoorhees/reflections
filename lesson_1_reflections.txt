How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You could look at only the differences between files for the error, rather than parse the entire code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You'd be able to trace exactly when errors were introduced and could fix them without wasting as much time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing means that you can save at opportune moments before making large changes,
    although you run the risk of not saving content passively.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Presumably, since Git is focused on coding and Docs is more general use,
    code files often require secondary files to function.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Presumably log would show the history of files, and diff would show the differences between them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You could always undo a mistake without losing the saved safe state.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Tracking versions of my website and undoing shopify app installations.
