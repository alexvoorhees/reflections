When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Using a remote repository would allow you to exchange code with coworkers or
between multiple computers that you had access to. It'd also be insurance in
case of hardware failure. The big drawback would be that you'd be unable to
access the code without internet signal, but that's a rare problem these days.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The nature of coding is that files are frequently in states of disorder or
testing. By forcing users to decide on specific points in time for changes
to be pulled or pushed, GitHub ensures that every save point can be tied
to a logical change rather than to random chronological markers.
